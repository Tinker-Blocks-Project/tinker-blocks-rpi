# Assistant Module

The assistant module provides an AI-powered programming tutor for children using the TinkerBlocks system. It integrates LangGraph's react agent with custom tools to help children learn programming concepts through interactive guidance with their physical programming blocks and robot control.

## üîß Key Components

### AI Assistant Workflow (`workflow.py`)
- **`assistant_workflow()`**: Main workflow function that processes child messages
- **LangGraph Integration**: Uses `create_react_agent` for intelligent tool selection
- **Educational Focus**: Designed specifically for teaching programming to children
- **Real Robot Control**: Integrates with vision and engine modules for complete pipeline

### Tools Factory (`tools.py`)
- **`create_assistant_tools()`**: Factory function that creates LangChain tools with dependencies
- **Reusable Design**: Can be used by other parts of the system
- **Context-Aware**: Tools have access to send_message, controller, and ocr_engine

### Educational Prompt (`prompt.py`)
- **`assistant_system_prompt`**: Comprehensive system prompt for the AI tutor
- **Command Reference**: Complete guide to all TinkerBlocks programming commands
- **Teaching Guidelines**: Educational best practices for working with children
- **Progressive Learning**: Structured approach from basic to advanced concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### **read_blocks**
Reads and understands the current block arrangement on the grid using OCR.
- Captures image of physical blocks
- Uses AI-powered vision to extract commands
- Formats results for educational explanation

### **execute_program**
Runs programs on the robot car to demonstrate concepts.
- Supports current grid or custom examples
- Real hardware execution for authentic experience
- Educational feedback on program results

### **think**
Shares the AI's thinking process with the child.
- Makes problem-solving transparent
- Teaches logical reasoning
- Builds programming intuition

### **answer**
Delivers final responses and educational guidance.
- Child-friendly explanations
- Encouraging and positive tone
- Builds on previous thinking process

## üîÑ Assistant Workflow

The workflow follows the standard protocol and integrates seamlessly with the existing system:

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Greeting**: Welcome the child and acknowledge their message
2. **Tool Creation**: Use factory to create tools with proper dependencies
3. **Agent Creation**: Build LangGraph react agent with chat model and tools
4. **Processing**: Let AI agent intelligently use tools to help the child
5. **Completion**: Provide encouraging completion message

### Usage Example:

```python
from assistant.workflow import assistant_workflow
from core import ProcessController
from vision.ocr import VLM_OCR

# Run assistant workflow
success, result = await controller.run_workflow(
    lambda send_message: assistant_workflow(
        send_message=send_message,
        user_message="How do I make my robot draw a square?",
        controller=controller,
        ocr_engine=ocr_engine,
    ),
    "AI Assistant",
)
```
